# Federated Continual Learning for Privacy-focused Energy Forecasting


## Abstract
This thesis presents an approach to forecasting energy production using Federated
Learning and clustering techniques. The proposed system is designed to be fully generic,
allowing any energy production site to join the network at any time without compromising
privacy or data security.
One relevant aspect of the system involves clustering energy production sites based on
relevant characteristics and creating individual cluster models. These models are then
trained using Federated Learning, ensuring that no raw data leaves the local devices. Un-
like traditional Federatead Learning approaches that use synchronous rounds, this system
implements a fully asynchronous and continual learning process, adapting to the reality
that data becomes available over time. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
are employed as the underlying Machine Learning model. The systemâ€™s performance is
compared to centralized learning methods to evaluate its efficacy.
This research contributes to the field of federated and continual energy forecasting by
demonstrating a privacy-preserving, scalable, and adaptable approach.
